# Data Test A - Dependencies Orchestration

This is a working solution for Sephora SEA data test parts A1, A2 and A3. Part B is available in the following repo: [data-test-sde-alan-B](https://github.com/emailayuen/data-test-sde-alan-B).

## Requirements

* Python 3.7 (3.6 should suffice but untested)

## Setup

To run the code, please follow the instructions below.

  1. Pull down the code to your local machine.
  
  2. To run, pass the path of the program as an argument to the Python interpreter. If you do not have a working Python 3.7 interpreter, instructions to download and setup can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```
  Example:
  
  C:\Users\alan\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\python.exe C:\git\data-test-sde-alan-A\main.py
