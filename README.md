# Data Test A - Dependencies Orchestration

This is a working solution for Sephora SEA data test parts A1, A2 and A3. Part B is available in the following repo: [data-test-sde-alan-B](https://github.com/emailayuen/data-test-sde-alan-B).

## Requirements

* Python 3.7 (3.6 should suffice but untested)


## Setup

To run the program...

  1. Pull down the source code to your local machine and navigate to the project folder.
  
  ```
  Example:
  
  cd C:\git\data-test-sde-alan-A
  
  ```
  
  2. To run, pass the path of the program as an argument to the Python interpreter. If you do not have a working Python 3.7 interpreter, instructions to download and setup can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```
  Example:
  
  C:\git\data-test-sde-alan-A>python main.py
  
  ```
